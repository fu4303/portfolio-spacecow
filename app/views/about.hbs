        <p class="no-indent">This website is written on Express with NodeJS, deployed on an Ubuntu server via <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Digital Ocean</a>. It makes use of a modern technology stack, with ES6 JavaScript, mobile-first SCSS, Handlebars, and automation with Grunt, Bower, and npm. <a href="https://github.com/mimikim/seeyouspacecow-node" target="_blank" data-track data-category="About Page" data-action="Clicked Github Repo">Read the code on Github</a>!</p>
        <p>I have been exploring creative expression with web technologies since I was a pre-teen. I bought my first domain name and hosting space when I was 13, and before then I managed several sites on Geocities and Angelfire.</p>
        <p>When I am not busy developing websites, I can be found tending to my plants, creating paintings using digital or traditional mediums, or binge-watching episodes of Law&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Order or Star&nbsp;Trek. I've recently tried taking up viola again after a long (10 years!?) break.</p>
        <p><span class="happycow"></span>I was in love with SNES emulation as a child, and the video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(video_game)" target="_blank" data-track data-category="About Page" data-action="Clicked Harvest Moon" aria-label="Read more about Harvest Moon">Harvest&nbsp;Moon</a> left a strong impression on me. Cute sprite cows in particular. I've since doodled a little cow everywhere, and they are the inspiration behind this site's theme.</p>
        <p>Yes, I have played <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a> and yes, I LOVE IT!!</p>
        <p>"See You Space Cow" is a play on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop" target="_blank" data-track data-category="About Page" data-action="Clicked Cowboy Bebop" aria-label="Read more about Cowboy Bebop">Cowboy&nbsp;Bebop's</a> famous postscript: "see you space cowboy". It just seemed like the most natural progression...</p>
