# seeyouspacecow-node
node version of my portfolio website

es6 js, postcss, nodejs, express, handlebars, grunt, bower

### To use:

`npm install`

`bower install`

`gulp`

`npm start` (this command runs `sudo node index`)

#### Notes:

site will be accessible at `http://localhost` 

the server runs on port 8000

node files are all inside `/app`, and so are all asset source files

all public-facing files are inside `/public` and are generated by grunt during development

development is compiled with grunt tasks, which are defined inside the `/grunt` folder

vendor packages managed with bower

#### TODO:

integrate database calls to generate content server-side
